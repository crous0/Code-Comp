    <h2>Walk</h2>
    <img src="Walk..jpg" alt="Walk" width="600" hight="600">
    <p>Take your horse into a ring and mount it. When learning to walk your horse, it’s a good idea to work with the animal in a contained area, such as a ring. Get up onto your saddle by using mounting blocks or pulling yourself up onto the horse.
      Make sure your saddle is tight before getting on. Position yourself correctly on the horse. Sit upright and put your feet in the stirrups, if you are using them. Even when having your horse walk at a slow pace, you should have proper posture while on your horse. Be sure that your head is lined up directly above your spine and hips, forming a straight line
      Ask the horse to move by giving it a light squeeze with your lower legs. This should be a quick movement done right where your legs are positioned in the stirrups. Release your leg pressure from the horse as it starts moving.
      If your horse stops give it another gentle squeeze. <b>Remember to keep your heels down to maintain balance</b> Lastly focus on keeping your posture upright but relaxed.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Trot</h2>
      <img src="Trot..jpg" alt="trot" width="600" hight="600">
    <p>Sit up tall in your saddle. To keep upright and balanced, place the balls of your feet in your stirrups, if you are using them, and have your sits bones planted on the saddle. Your head, shoulders, spine, hips, and sits bones should all be in a straight line.
      Start in a walk so you can transition to trotting. When learning to ride a horse at a trot, it’s easiest to start the horse walking and then work up to a trot. Get the horse moving by squeezing your lower legs briefly.
      Tell the horse to trot by squeezing your legs and gently pulling the reins. Give the horse a couple brisk squeezes with your lower legs. At the same time, shorten the reins by 1–2 inches <i>(2.5–5.1 cm)</i>
      Absorb the movement of the horse. Keep your hips, knees, and ankles supple and springy, and absorb the movement through your seat. Imagine that you are melting down into the saddle, so that your seat becomes deep and heavy.
      <B><u>Avoid bounceing in the saddle</u></b>
      Try posting once you have practice with the trot. Posting is a rising and falling riding technique that only works when you can sit the trot comfortably. To post, you rise up with one beat of the trot, and sit down the next. Keep an even pressure on your stirrups, and allow the horse to move you.
      <i>Tip, pick a shoulder of the horse and move along with it (Up when it goes up and down when it goes down)</i></p>
      <br>

      <h2>Canter</h2>
      <img src="Canter..jpg" alt="canter" width="600" hight="600">
    <p>Distinguish the canter from the walk and the trot. The canter is three-beat gait with a rocking motion. This is a quicker speed than walk and trot that also requires greater balance on the rider’s part, so it should only be done after you have mastered the walk and the trot.
      Build up to a canter by starting at a trot. It is important that your horse is moving with impulsion before you ask for it to canter. Get the horse walking with a quick squeeze of the lower legs and then get it into a trot with another squeeze and light pressure on the reins.
      Tell your horse to canter by putting pressure on its girth and reins. To transition from trot to canter, sit down in the saddle and deepen your seat, which means that you need to tilt your body forward just slightly so more of your sits bones have contact with the saddle.
      Focus your energy on keeping your seat grounded on the saddle. Once you've begun cantering, allow your seat to deepen and follow the horse’s movement.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Gallop</h2>
      <img src="gallop..jpg" alt="gallop" width="600" hight="600">
      <p> <B>IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ONLY GALLOP ONCE YOU HAVE MASTERED THE CANTER!</b>
        Lean forward once you are in a canter, with your body slightly raised from the saddle. Use the pressure of your legs to make the horse go faster at a steady rate.
        Use your knees to support you as you ride. Don't balance yourself by pulling the reins and don't be tempted to go too fast.
        Hold the reins in both hands in the bridge configuration. This means holding the reins in one hand between your thumb and forefinger. Let a short length of the reins go across the horse's neck, and hold the reins in the thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Your hands could lie on the neck of the horse. Holding the reins in this way will give you more control over the horse.
        Use the reins to get the horse to slow down, when it's time to stop. Return to a sitting position in the saddle. If you want to stop but the horse doesn't want to do so, simply remain sitting straight in the saddle and steer the horse in smaller and smaller circles. The horse will go slower and slower in order to keep its balance and you will be able to come to a stop.</p>
