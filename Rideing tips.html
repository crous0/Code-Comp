  <table>Helmets are NOT negotiable: Before you get on, make sure you are wearing a properly fitting horse riding helmet. It can save your life in the event of an unplanned dismount, so make sure yours fits well. </table>
        <br>
  <table>Stay alert: Riding is super fun, and when you’re first learning, it’s easy to get distracted. You are dealing with a living, breathing animal who might behave unpredictably. You’ll learn to understand “horse talk” better as you progress, but keep your eyes open and be aware of your horse, other horses around you, and the surroundings. Your toes (and pride) will be happier for it.</table>
        <br>
  <table>Protect your feet: Speaking of toes, proper boots are a must. You don’t need to purchase new ones for your first riding experience.</table>
